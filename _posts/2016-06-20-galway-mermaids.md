Today was an ocean day. We walked along the shimmering mystic sea. It’s very different than the Pacific ocean; it’s much greener and glitters more. It is surprisingly warm. In fact as we were walking along the beach, we stumbled upon a swimming area with a diving board and all. Clara and I decided to  jump in and I’m **so** glad we did. The diving board was about 15-20 feet high and the water was refreshing and delicious. It felt every bit as wonderful as it looked! Mame did yoga, including a headstand on the beach, while we scavenged for shells. The ocean was so magical that I could almost imagine a mermaid slithering out onto the rocks by the light of the moon.
