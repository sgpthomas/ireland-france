Rouen is way down in a valley from where we are staying. The kids were talking about the long, steep hill they had to bike up last night and why they were so late getting home. Now I understand and I was amazed at how much territory they covered. They just hopped on the bikes, borrowed from our hosts, and took off after dinner, no maps, no plan, just the freedom of being young, fearless and adventuresome. It truly is a joy being with them; sometimes just the group effort of maneuvering the car out of the tight driveway or walking to the grocery store is as much fun as sightseeing.

However, this afternoon we did have the wonderful good luck of going in to see an old cathedral  just as a choir was about to perform Gabriel Faureâ€™s Requiem, accompanied by the large pipe organ.  The choir sounded like angels singing in that amazing space; it was such beautiful music and it felt like a special gift. There was no discussion about what to do- everyone immediately sat down to listen.
