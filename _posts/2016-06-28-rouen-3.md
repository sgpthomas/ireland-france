Our outing for today was visiting a very old Benedictine Abbey, in ruins. What was really special was an extensive contemporary art installation throughout the beautiful and extensive grounds, and a photography exhibit in one of the ancient buildings. I loved the old and new art displayed together. 

The Seine is nearby. We walked along the river for a while and were especially interested in the little car ferry that could cross the river in less than five minutes. It made many trips over and back, because there are no bridges along this section of the Seine.
