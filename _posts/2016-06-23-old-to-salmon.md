### Polly Peacock
I’m so sorry to be leaving tomorrow. Before this trip, I thought my heritage was English, but now I know it’s got to be Irish. It feels like these people are my cousins and that I belong here. 

One of our major activities is food shopping, it’s astounding how fast the food disappears with four hungry teenagers. Dick and I could get along in a week on what we go through in a day. Fortunately, the kids do the cooking, and they are very good! 

The best grocery store is SuperValu and there seems to be one in every small town. Yesterday we found a wholesale fish market where you ring a bell, one of the workers comes out, and you tell him what you want. There is a very big selection at very reasonable prices. Something like 3½ pounds of fish vanished in a flash. It was so incredibly fresh and good that we returned this evening for more. 

### An Ode to Salmon by Keziah Dutt
The fish! It’s creamy, flavorful, tender, melt-in-your-mouth, and so fresh. We got some yesterday at a smelly warehouse and it was so delicious we came back today. We bought a tiny amount of salmon, sea  bass, and a lot of whiting. The salmon was by far the best I’ve ever had, and probably ever will. It felt like discovering an entirely new type of fish as it was so different from the tough smelly stuff that we have at home. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to eat salmon again in Reno – I’ll just be thinking of the fresh salmon here in Ireland.

As we were cooking it, Clara and I sampled some and exclaimed in delighted suspense over the fireworks of flavor exploding in our mouths. This brought in Mame who immediately stuck a piece in her mouth. In turn, her moan of happiness attracted everyone else. As six people fought to eat the salmon, Clara was trying to shoo everyone away with her spatula. I was laughing hysterically, Mame was raving about the merits of the fish, and Dick, Katrina, and Sam were pushing and shoving each other trying to reach the pan.  It was like a pack of wild wolves fighting over a carcass! Once everyone settled down enough to sit, we enjoyed the Salmon, almost like normal, civilized human beings.
