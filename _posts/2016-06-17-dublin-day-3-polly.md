Our plan when we left the house was to hire bikes from one of the many Dublin bike share stands around town. The fee structure wasn't immediately obvious, so while Sam was figuring it out, I started talking with a few of the very friendly people returning bikes. Apparently it's common for businessmen who have meetings in another part of the city to hop on a hired bike instead of taking a cab. None of them thought that our plan of riding out to the coast on the heavy three-speed bikes was a good idea, so we opted for the DART train instead.

A serendipitous conversation on the train sent us to a town we hadn't planned to visit and a wonderful library and an excellent exhibit called, the "Press Photographers of the Year Awards 2016." We got into interesting conversations with some of the people in the exhibit over several of the pictures. I love the architecture here. The old Georgian castles and churches that sat on either sides of a state of the art modern library that was filled with glass and unusual shapes. It was such a vivid contrast.

This really is an appealing capital city. So many people outside walking, eating, cycling. There is so much energy here. There are big windows and pretty flowers growing out of the ubiquitous stone walls. It all makes me want to re-red *The Dubliners* by James Joyce (but not *Finnegan's Wake*.)
