It was back into the car to travel down to Kenmare on the Beara Peninsula in Country Kerry. Google thought it should only take 3½ hours but it took us more like 6½ hours, counting stops. Sunday’s maiden voyage on the wonderful freeway was a breeze compared to this trip. The roads were tiny, narrow, and twisting with giant tour buses or large trucks around every bend. It was a miracle that we got here without mishap1 I think it was almost more difficult for Sam, the poor guy. He had to be calm,  patient, reassuring and keep the passengers in the back seats from screaming in terror (I was the only one who was allowed to do that). I told him he could have a good career as a driver’s ed instructor but he didn’t seem to excited about that. The scenery was spectacular down near Killarney National Park but every time I turned to look, Sam would tell me to keep my eyes on the road! What a guy!

It was a harrowing six hour drive from Galway to Kenmare. The roads were twisty, narrow, and altogether too small for our van. All of the lush plant life was stopped by nothing except the pavement of the road. Many cows and sheep were enjoying the feast of green before them. Sam was very patient with Mame, telling her exactly what to do: “Turn left. Stay on the left! Don’t stop in the middle of the roundabout. Keep your eyes on the road. Go faster.” I supposedly four hour drive took way longer, but Mame was a trooper. We were still quite frazzled by the end of the journey though. Poppyfield house, our AirBnb, is wonderful. There is a big, lovely glassed-in room and spectacular views of the surrounding valley. The friendly host welcome us and provided breakfast in the morning. Last night we cooked dinner and then went into Kenmare and walked around the bay and a forest park. We got trapped and were forced to hop a stone wall into a church to get out. Sam and Keziah found some wooden crosses and carried them around. This is my favorite part of Ireland so far. It’s so beautiful!
