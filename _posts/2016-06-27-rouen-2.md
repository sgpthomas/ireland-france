It was a rainy morning but we headed up to the coast of Normandy anyway. Much to our surprise we had a sunny afternoon to explore the very unusual cliffs and rock formations around the popular little town of Etretat. Despite the rough seas, the kids went swimming out to a large floating raft and climbed up onto it and spent quite a while enjoying bobbing around on the waves.

I miss Ireland, the people here aren’t nearly as friendly and it’s often frustrating not speaking or reading the language. Driving is much easier and Sam gets me through the many roundabouts - sometimes there 4 or 5 in a row.  All the major roads have expensive tolls. The old architecture is a delight but check out the pictures of a new housing development just down the road. What a contrast!
