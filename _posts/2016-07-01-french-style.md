Paris – what a place – this is my third visit but I’d forgotten about it’s magic. The city is noisy, crowded, dirty, and filled with delights. Actually, it’s almost overwhelming: from the grand buildings – elaborate, stately, ancient, speaking of a past that I realize that I know little about – to the very efficient metro system. There is a delightful street market that starts right around the corner and goes on for blocks on an already narrow and crowded sidewalk; it’s filled with fresh fish, fruit, flowers, clothes – how do they do it? Suddenly we are part of a whole different way of life, and although we have lots of metro maps and street maps, there is no map for the mind and spirit in this incredible city.

I am in awe of the French style. Almost everybody here is dressed stylishly and carefully, and I instinctively gravitate towards the French style. I now own a beret as a lovely red wraparound silk skirt and a pair of colorful pants, that Dick my “harem pants.”
