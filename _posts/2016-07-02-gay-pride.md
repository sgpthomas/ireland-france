### Polly Peacock
I think that my Paris will be our visit to the Foundation Louis Vuitton and the wonderfully imaginative, colorful, sail-like building designed by my favorite architect Frank Gehry. It’s set in a spacious and inviting forested park which includes many activities for children, a venue for concerts, cafes, and a large child friendly fountain, which included steam in addition to the ever changing water jets; I’d never seen that before. And, in addition, much about the Gehry Museum was unusual: the multi-colored reflective glass panels, the extensive out door terraces providing views of Paris skyscrapers and the surrounding woods. The theme of the exhibits inside was China past and present. There were mostly giant sculptures and multi-screen videos. It was thrilling! 

What shall I say about our other activity today – the Paris Gay Pride Parade. Even though I was one of the voices saying “lets go,” I was overwhelmed by the noise, crushing crowds, and outrageous flaunting behavior by the gay marchers. 

### Clara’s Gay Pride Impressions
The Paris Gay Pride Parade was as flamboyant and wild as I had expected it to be. Many rainbow capes billowed in the wake of the floats filled with scantily clad gay men and women, and outrageous drag queens tottering on trashy high heels, all dancing wildly to the blasting music that seemed to be one long crescendo of noise.

### Dick’s Impressions
My take on this, having seen a few, is that it was fairly typical – the bare chests, the leasther jock strapes, the ear-splitting music, the hopped up flamboyant dancing (flailing), and alo the close-pressed river of spectators following along, which we were part of. We started at the Hotel de Velle and, having coaught only the last part, pushed our way through enough to see some of the earlier part too. Mostly there were mounted on huge flatbed trucks; some others, enclosed, had speakers stacked all the way to the top. Incredibly loud! Little rainbow flags everywhere, and I forget to mention we had to go through security to get it – Paris having seen more than enough terrorism lately. One novetly was a truck for the first proclaimed first Asiatic gay group. There was also one all black vehicle – **not** the most flamboyant!
