A centimeter at a time, we helped Mame get the rental car â€“ her first time driving on the left hand side of the road It was slightly terrifying at first, but once we were on the motorway to Galway, Mame was fine. We arrived late afternoon and checked into our very nice AirBnB. There was lots of space and light. We went to the supermarket downstairs (right below us) and cooked a curry with rice and vegetables. Then, we went into the town and looked in on pubs until we found *The Crane* with traditional live music playing. It was the perfect pub atmosphere! Intimate, lively, and no amplifiers for the 5-6 musicians that were playing. The music was lovely. There was a portrait of someone on the wall behind the band (it was a session night) and at one point a man just walked into the pub, took the painting off the wall, and just left without a word. The pub was upstairs, dimly lit with candles and soft glowing lights and everyone was really into the music. This was my favorite so far. Afterwards, Sam, Clara, and I walked around Galway at night. The canals were nice and the cathedral at night was lit up and beautiful.
