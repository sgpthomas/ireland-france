## P.S. to Wednesday's Post

What Polly neglected to mention yesterday is how she charmed her way, with four minors, into the Pub on music night. The doorkeeper was affable and casual, but he did stand in the door with his hands on the frame the whole time. After much friendly conversation, only some of which was about how we couldn’t come to Ireland and not hear traditional music in a Pub, he looked us over and asked how old the kids were. Keziah admitted to 14, and well, that was going to be that; but after more regrets and such on all sides, he surprised us by getting a nearby employee to take us in through a back door. We wound up sitting almost the closest to the music, Polly got a Guinness, and we stayed for the whole set. Of course the music was deafening and somewhat murky over the bar noise, but isn’t that part of the traditional experience too.
