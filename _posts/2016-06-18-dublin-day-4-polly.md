“Mind the gap” and “don’t put your feets on the seats” the voice of the train kept repeating at every stop as we headed south to Dublin Mountain. So I kept thinking about all of the gaps I could “mind”: between land and sea, rich and poor, between thinking and presence and mostly between young and old, as you will see from the pictures. Even though the mountain wasn’t very tall, the old tower on top definitely was. I have four brave grandchildren, and even though I was concerned and could hear the voices of their parents warning them to be careful, I was actually proud of their daring actions. The gap between young and old was very wide up there. It never really occurred to Dick or me to climb up those narrow stone steps!
