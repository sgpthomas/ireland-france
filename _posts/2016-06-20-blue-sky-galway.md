How wonderful this morning to wake up to sunshine and large swathes of blue sky. Galway Bay sparkled. I can see way people have written songs about this place. We spent all afternoon walking the paths that rim it. We went way out to a grassy point which was especially beautiful, exept I took a wrong turn and walked into a patch of nettles! They seem to grow everywhere, and boy do they sting! Even the briefest contact and my legs sting for 24 hours or more. It’s horrible! Even though it was very windy and not especially warm, Clara and Keziah decided to go swimming. You can see the high tower they jumped off. The other swimmers, mostly Irish ones, kept saying, “Ahh! Its warm water! 55 degrees.” Of course, no one had a towel or a bathing suit for that matter. The rest of us, as we waited, got into a long conversation with a friendly Irishman, but this isn’t hard to do and something that I enjoy a lot.
