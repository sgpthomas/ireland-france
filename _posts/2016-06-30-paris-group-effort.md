What is love … if not walking along the Seine with a beautiful girl in a French beret. So it must have been after we left the Marais with two new berets. We stumbled upon them after eating an afternoon gelato. They are 100% wool and were quite cheap. Keziah chose one of a gorgeous burgundy red color and Clara picked a olive green one. We walked around Paris in a true French style; with berets. 

What is love … if not eating French bread and cheese on a bench amidst a beautiful park. So it must have been delicately devouring the chocolate pastries in the cool morning amidst the bamboo. Well, I wouldn’t be so crude as to say we devoured the pastries, it was more of a delicate devouring; now there’s some oxymoron action. I love Paris for the same reason’s that Miles Davis did; everyone is open and welcoming, and people focus on doing the simple things well, such as delicately devouring delicious chocolate pastries. 

What is love … Is it Paris in the spring time or is it walking along the Seine or riding the subway and catching every single transfer without waiting. Actually, it’s being here with my four grandchildren and really enjoying all of their energy and enthusiasm.
