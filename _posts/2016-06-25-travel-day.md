Friday was a grueling day of travel. First we had a long drive from Kenmare to Dublin, then we turned in our nice VW van **SAFE AND SOUND**!! There was lots of waiting at Ryanair: first to check in, and then for the delayed flight, which itself didn’t take long at all. The tickets cost 20 euros each. Checking two bags cost 50 euros! Then we walked over to the budget hotel which was convenient and close. The 30 minute walk to get there was refreshing after the cramped flight. 

At the last minute Enterprise Rental Cars *discovered* that they didn’t have the van that we had reserved several months ago. Since we weren’t able to talk to anyone, we just showed up, and Dick demanded in French that they do something for us. So they got us a smaller SUV type vehicle that they had to drive over from Paris. We had to cram four passengers in the back seat which was designed for three. It’s a manual transmission which means that Dick can’t drive, which he was looking forward to doing. And I was looking forward to **NOT** driving and relax with my Jack Reacher novel in the back seat. Since we had three or four hours to kill before picking up the car, we walked into Beauvais, which is a pretty town with a wonderful old Cathedral; beautiful stained glass windows, and a very high vaulted ceiling. 

Now we are in Rouen at a very nice and spacious AirBnb. We enjoyed a bottle of delicious French wine with our hosts before they left. After our first French dining experience, the kids went on a long bike ride all around Rouen; they had been cooped up for two days.
