We made it to Dublin, Ireland but just by the skin of our teeth. Our flight from Reno to Chicago was delayed by almost an hour, and since we only had an hour between flights, we were really sweating it. It turned out that they held the plane for us! It was such a relief to join up with Sam and Clara who were on board waiting for us (as was everyone else.) 

Dublin is a delightful city! There is such interesting architecture and I have never seen so many red doors! A favorite highlight of mine was listening to a very lively two person traditional Irish band in an honest to goodness pub - while drinking a pint of Guinness of course. What energy those guys had! We did remarkably well finding our way around considering everyone was jet-lagged and eight hours off. We got to bed at 1:30am and woke up late.

Now we're finally heading out for day #2. It's 12:30pm and I'm already tired. It looks like rain.
