Today it was my turn to have courage and be daring. Driving in Ireland, on the wrong side of the road, was something Iâ€™ve been worrying about for literally months. One huge piece of good luck was that it was Sunday, and hence there was very little traffic on the road. That made a **huge** difference. The other factor that made it all possible was Sam, who was right next to me every step of the journey. He is a very capable navigator and told me exactly what to do. 

I loved our van. It was a brand new VW diesel which handled very easily. I had great confidence in it, especially as it rained the entire day. Driving an automatic is also much easier. The motorway is much easier than the city streets. Our traveling music included Vivaldi and various pieces like Autobahn by the German group Kraftwerk. 

Even though the 125 mile drive only took a few hours, I was exhausted when we finally arrived. I felt like Id been driving all day. Even though Galway is a charming little city, I find I miss the energy and excitement of Dublin.
