If Dublin is the city of colorful doors, then Kenmare is the city of colored buildings. Each store is painted a different bright color. Our AirBnB here is the best one yet; spacious, clean, cozy, and light. The kitchen is huge and lots of fun to cook in. There is a little sun room attached to the dining room with lots of comfy couches. I’m not sure if we’ll ever leave the house becuase it’s so nice! I feel at home in Kenmare – more so than any other place we’ve visited in Ireland. It seems greener here, and much more wild. The sea is irresistibly magnetic – as soon as I see it, I want to walk right into it, regardless of the weather or anything else. There’s a kind of magic in Ireland that is tamped down in the big cities by all the people, but here in Kenmare, you can still feel it. You can feel it in the forest carpeted moss that’s an impossible shade of green. You can feel it in the silver sea with it’s magnetic pull. You can feel it when the sky mists down on you, and you can feel it running along that winding forest path. No wonder Ireland has myths of fairies and leprechauns and pots of gold at the end of a rainbow; it’s a truly magical country.

Old stone walls, houses, churches, and fences are everywhere and beautiful. They have been here so long that they have almost became another part of the scenery. Patches of lichen and moss and beautiful little flowers cling to these walls that have become such an essential part of the Irish landscape. It’s the season for foxgloves here. Their tall stocks decorated with purple cups provide a beautiful contrast to the greenery here. We were worried about finding a peaceful place in touristy Kenmare, but because of another one of our chance encounters with a local Irishman, we were directed to a beautiful and abandoned valley. Besides the plentiful sheep, we were the only living souls around.
