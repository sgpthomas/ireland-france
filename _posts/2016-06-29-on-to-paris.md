Another grueling travel day; squished into the car like a pack of sardines and listening to Kraftwerk. That music makes me want to scream bloody murder and tear all my hair out! We stopped to see Chartes cathedral which was as grand as it’s reputation. They were tuning the organ and the chords they played were foreboding and ominous. It added a measure of tension to the whole scene. I think I realized for the first time the meaning of “the fear of God.” There was so much detail to the Church; it was much bigger and more elaborate than the previous cathedrals we have visited and not quite as Gothic. One could spend years trying to decipher the scenes pictured in status on the walls. I wish that people would build things like that in this day and age. I can’t imagine building something that would take several generations!
