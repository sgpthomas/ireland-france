Our time is running out. Tomorrow is our last day. After visiting the l’Orangerie to see Monet’s waterlilies, we began to split up. Dick wanted to visit his old haunts so he took of by himself for one last stroll around Paris. The rest of us went to Parc de Buttes-Chaumonte, a particularly nice park in the Northeast part of Paris for a picnic of our favorite French lunch: fresh bread from a nearby boulangerie and some tasty cheese. Shopping for and eating food has remained a major activity. Mostly the kids do the planning, shopping, and cooking; Dick and I have gotten off easy on this trip. First thing in the morning, someone heads off for breakfast pastries that are fresh out of the oven and still warm. After lunch and a nap on the grass, the girls headed off to the Lourve. Sam, being the thoughtful and sweet guy that he is, stayed to keep me company. We walked around the beautiful and spacious park, and then down to the St. Martin Canal and the la Villette Parc. How special was that time we had together; a memory that I will always treasure. I am so grateful that we caught Sam for this trip, just before he heads off to college and a whole new life. 

At the conclusion of this journey and this blog, which we are doing together on the airplane on the way back home, I want to give a special thanks to my oldest grandchild and only grandson for being my special buddy. He guided me, gave me confidence, kept everybody calm, and walked me step-by-step through driving on the wrong side of the road in Ireland and the many round-a-bouts in France. I could never have done it without him! Katrina also greatly contributed to the success of the trip. She did most of the planning and made sure that we had places to stay everywhere we went. We couldn't have done this trip without her. The energy and enthusiasm of the whole group that made this such a successful trip. The group dynamics really worked. This also gave me the opportunity to get to know these really wonderful people, especially the two who live in Los Angeles whom I don’t get to see nearly enough.
