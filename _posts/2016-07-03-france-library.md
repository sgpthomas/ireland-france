One of my favorite activities when visiting new cities is to check out the library. As you might expect, the newish (1995) National Library of France in Paris is like none other. In fact, from the outside, it doesn’t look like a library at all – just four L-shaped high rise towers – not even close together. The very large esplanade is absolutely empty, not a bench or a table or anything inviting one to linger. There is no color either. There are glimpses of a sunken forest, which seems odd. Why is it way down there? When we finally found the entrance, it became clear. One descends to enter the building and then the forest is visible through the glass. Nobody is allowed into this “mysterious and sacred forbidden garden.” An artist had painted a 195 meter mural on an entire row of windows – monochromatic again. At first it just seemed like finger painting, but after a while lots of shapes and figures began to emerge. 

The metro system here is one of my favorite things about Paris; it’s incredibly efficient. A big electric sign tells you when the next two trains are due, usually in the next two minutes. The stations are clean and there is often someone playing music. Today I noticed an elderly Asian man playing a traditional Chinese string instrument. The music was haunting and evocative of a distant world.
